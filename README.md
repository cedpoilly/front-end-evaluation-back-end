# Front-end Test Back-end

An API for my coaching clients to call when I do their front-end evaluations.

It is a simple CRUD API over one entity.

This repo is part of a larger project. Of course, I will not share the requirements for the front-end evaluation itself. ðŸ˜‰

NB: this is a work in progress.
